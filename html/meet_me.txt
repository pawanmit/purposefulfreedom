And I feel excited. I have come to the realization that I can create the life of my dreams without having to wait for the stars to align. 

For as long as I could remember, I never felt in control of my life. One day I would feel like shit and blame it on my job for being sucky. Next day I would feel on cloud nine and credit my job! I have dreams and desires but I always believed that some external circumstances have to change for them to become reality.

I read self help books, meditated, tried to think positive thinking and wrote page after pages of affirmation, all the time wondering why my life is not taking off? Why my dreams feel more like fantasies?

The piece of puzzle I was missing was ACTION!. Action is another dimension of thought.

Unfortunately, we tend to focus only on the thoughts that materialize as words in our consciousness. If we have read about law of attraction then boy oh boy, all day we are focusing on thoughts without taking action and wondering why our lives feel stuck?

For the last few months I am taking consistent action based on SFM marketing business system. I am seeing results that go much beyond an income stream. I am adding value and connecting with like minded individuals who share my passion for personal growth and mentorship.
