                        <strong>3.  CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.1.    For the purpose of this Membership Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall be deemed to include all information and materials that: (a) if in written format is marked as confidential, or (b) if disclosed verbally is noted as confidential at time of disclosure, or (c) in the absence of either (a) or (b) is information which a reasonable party would deem to be non-public information and confidential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.2.    Confidential Information shall include without limitation: this Membership Agreement; all information provided on and/or through the Website and/or our Services; trade secrets, inventions, research methods, methods of compiling information, methods of creating our database, procedures, devices, machines, equipment, data processing programs, software, computer models, research projects, and other means used by us in the conduct of our business; product formulations, strategies and plans for future business, new business, product or other development, new and innovative product ideas, potential acquisitions or divestitures, and new marketing ideas; information with respect to costs, commissions, fees, profits, sales, markets, sales methods and financial information; mailing lists, the identity of our customers, potential customers, distributors, and suppliers and their names and addresses, the names of customer representatives responsible for entering into contracts for our products or services, the amounts paid by customers to us, specific customer needs and requirements, and leads and referrals to prospective customers; and the structure, sequence, and organization of our database, together with source code and object code; and the identity of our employees, their respective salaries, bonuses, benefits, qualifications and abilities.

                    <p>
                        3.3.    You acknowledge and agree that the nature of our confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information to which you have, and will continue to have access to, derives value from the fact that it is not generally known and used by others in the highly competitive, international industry in which We compete. You further acknowledge and agree that, even in complete good faith, it would be impossible for you to work in a similar capacity for a competitor of ours without drawing upon and utilizing information gained pursuant to this Membership Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.4.    You acknowledge that you are receiving such Confidential Information in confidence and will not publish, copy, or disclose any Confidential Information without prior written consent from the Company.

You acknowledge that you will only use the Confidential Information to the extent necessary to promote your business, and that you will use best efforts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information to any third party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.5.    The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to any particular portion of Confidential Information which: (a) was in the public domain when we granted access to you; (b) entered the public domain through no fault of you subsequent to receipt; (c) was in your possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of the disclosure by us; (d) was rightfully communicated by a third party to you free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time of the originating party’s communication thereof to you; (e) was developed by you independently of and without knowledge or reference to any Confidential Information; (f) is approved for release by written authorization from us; or (g) is required to be disclosed pursuant to any statute, law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority or pursuant to any order of any court of competent jurisdiction, but in any case, you will immediately notify us before disclosure and given a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order or other form of protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.6.    You agree not to alone or in association with others use Confidential and/or trade secret information to (a) solicit, or facilitate any organization with which you are associated in soliciting, any contractor, employee or customer of ours to alter its relationship with us; (b) solicit for employment, hire, or engage as an independent contractor, or facilitate any organization with which We are associated in soliciting for employment, hire, or engagement as an independent contractor, any person who was employed by us at any time during the term of this Membership Agreement (provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to any individual whose employment with us was terminated for a period of one year or longer); or (c) solicit business from or perform services for any customer, supplier, licensee, or business relation of ours, induce or attempt to induce, any such entity to cease doing business with us; or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such entity and us.

                    <p>
                        3.7.    You agree that you will not make any derogatory statements, either oral or written, or otherwise disparage us, our products, employees, services, work and/or employment, and will take all reasonable steps to prevent others from making derogatory or disparaging statements. You agree that it would be impossible, impractical, or extremely difficult to fix the actual damages suffered by reason of a breach of this paragraph, and accordingly hereby agree that five thousand dollars ($5,000) shall be presumed to be the amount of damages sustained by reason of each such breach, without prejudice to our right to also seek injunctive or other equitable relief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.8.    Other than as expressly provided for herein, in no event shall you be deemed by virtue hereof to have acquired any right or interest by license or otherwise, in or to the Confidential Information.

                        <strong>A.  MARKETING AND TRADEMARKS</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A.1.    SFM is designed to provide a level playing field for all its independent Affiliates and to prevent "sponsor shopping" (and cross recruiting) by or on behalf of its Customers/Users. In the case of a dispute, the new Customer enrollment is credited to the affiliate who FIRST generated the new Customer as a lead or application. The disputing affiliates may agree to allow a new Customer to move if the Customer agrees, but the credit for the enrollment rightfully belongs to the affiliate that generated the original lead or application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>A.2.    Cross Recruiting: </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        a)  SFM will not tolerate any active marketing of personal services, or proprietary derivatives of personal services, to any SFM member outside of your personal sales organization. This process, known as "cross recruiting" will result in immediate account suspension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b)  SFM is designed provide an equal opportunity for every marketer regardless of their experience and level of income. In order to maintain the integrity of the system, SFM uses a 3-strike "poaching" policy. Automatic monthly internal account audits ensure that new members are enrolled under the appropriate sponsor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c)  All SFM members who are found to enroll a new member who is NOT originally their applicant will be asked to explain why they enrolled that new member. If a satisfactory explanation for the violation cannot be provided, the account will be noted with a "strike." All members start with zero strikes and are allowed two strikes. Once a total of three strikes has been accumulated, the account will automatically be suspended for 30-days and labeled as "high risk" while we conduct a full audit and review of the account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d)  It is your responsibility to ensure that every member you enroll is YOUR applicant and not someone else's. If you are are unsure or feel like your prospect may not be completely honest with you, email support@thesfm.com to verify if there is already an application in the system for this person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        e)  We suggest that you specifically ask EVERY prospect if they have already spoken with another SFM member or submitted an application. If in doubt, you can even tell them that poaching and cross recruiting is strictly forbidden and that your account could possibly be suspended if you enroll them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have questions or concerns regarding this Membership Agreement, you should contact us by e-mailing compliance@digitalexpertsacademy.com and writing "Membership Agreement" in the subject line.
